This report is a detailed analysis associated with hospital patients at an anonymous hospitalization. The hospital is looking to utilize a curriculum to improve its service quality and productivity. In order to progress, this process undoubtedly starts with and ends with the patients in the hospital. The objective of this report is to break down by primarily dissecting the multiple factors related to the patients and seeking the correlation between those factors and the overall hospital productivity. In order to get to the root of the dilemma, several statistical methods were used to approach the problem, such as hypothesis tests (t-test), multiple linear regression and a nonparametric test. Based on the results of these findings, various statistical representations such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots and correlation graph were applied. By the end of this report, conclusions from the data can be drawn vividly to answer the unknown.  ![image](https://github.com/AlperTunahan/STAT250/assets/63862268/60eabd19-ce94-4eea-88df-c3c1cb848acf)
